# LUI-3 FontAwesome (4)

Contains `lui-3_icons-fontawesome` component which extends original FontAwesome 4.7.X (https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) with additional features, such as ability to use 1 class to put FA icon into `:before` or `:after` of an element.

**This repository does not contain Font Awesome.** It only adds custom CSS classnames for easier use.
